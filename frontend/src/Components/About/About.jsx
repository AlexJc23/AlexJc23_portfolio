            <p>
                Your friendly full-stack developer with a passion for React, Python, and all things tech! I bring ideas to life with a creative touch, blending design and development to build impactful, user-centric solutions that deliver results.

                <br />
                When I’m not coding something cool, you’ll find me geeking out over Marvel, leveling up in video games, hunting for rare Yu-Gi-Oh! cards, or creating mind-bending manipulation art for Instagram. Above all, I cherish spending quality time with my son and wife, making memories that last a lifetime.
                <br />
                <br />
                I graduated high school at 16 and jumped straight into the real world, where I discovered my passion for tech. Now, I’m focused on building innovative solutions, with the ultimate dream of running my own software empire someday. Let’s team up and create something extraordinary together!
